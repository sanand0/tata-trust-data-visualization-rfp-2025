## 12. Open Questions to Resolve

### Questions for Tata Trusts (via Email or Pre-Bid Meeting)

1. **Data Schema**: Can you share sample CSVs or exact column names for grants, beneficiaries, and outcomes data?

2. **Data Volume**: You mentioned "up to 100M beneficiary records" - is this cumulative or monthly? Helps size infrastructure.

3. **User Roles**: Phase 1 scope says "internal analytics teams and leadership" - approximately how many users? (<50, 50-100, 100+?)

4. **GIS Granularity**: Dashboard needs state/district/block/village levels - do you have latitude/longitude for villages, or should we geocode based on names?

5. **External Data Priority**: RFP lists Census, NFHS, NITI Aayog - if we had to pick 1-2 for Phase 1 POC, which would be most valuable?

6. **AI Agent**: RFP says "AI-enabled insights (optional)" - would demonstrating AI chart generation in Phase 1 strengthen proposal, or should it be pure Phase 2?

7. **Timeline Feasibility**: 8 weeks for full scope is aggressive. If timeline extends to 10-12 weeks, would that disqualify us, or is there flexibility?

8. **Existing Infrastructure**: Do you currently use Power BI (RFP mentions you have licenses)? Would integration with existing Power BI reports be valuable?

9. **Mapbox License**: Free tier covers 50K map loads/month. Estimate dashboard will need more in Phase 1. Should we budget for Mapbox paid tier (~$5-20K annually), or explore open-source alternatives like Leaflet?

10. **Submission Clarification**: RFP Annexure E mentions "max 12 pages / 5000 words" - does this apply to the full proposal or only the approach/methodology section?

### How to Submit Questions

- Email to: procurement.cci@tatatrusts.org, ankitthakur@tatatrusts.org
- Deadline: **08/11/2025** (per Calendar of Events)
- Format: Numbered list, one question per line
- Answers will be shared at pre-bid meeting on **11/11/2025**
