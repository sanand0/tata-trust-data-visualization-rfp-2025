## 2. Introduction

Trusts work across a wide range of thematic areas through a grant-making approach, supporting social development interventions at scale. These span multiple sectors including health, education, livelihoods, water and sanitation, and community development. Given the diversity and scale of programmes, large volumes of programmatic, financial, and impact-related data are generated through ongoing projects across geographies.

To enhance the use of this data for evidence-based decision-making, there is a need for an integrated data visualization system. Such a system will not only help in effective monitoring of progress against programmatic goals but also serve as a decision-support tool for identifying geographic and thematic priorities. By consolidating and presenting key indicators through an interactive and user-friendly geographical dashboard, the initiative will strengthen planning, reporting, and communication of impact with internal teams, partners, and other stakeholders.

The proposed engagement seeks to onboard a professional Data Visualization Agency that can design and develop geographical dashboards integrating programmatic, financial and impact data. This will enable the Trusts to derive actionable insights, track outcomes more effectively, and support strategic decision-making across its multi-thematic interventions.
